**Category:** Feature Enhancement

## Summary

Enhanced the history feature in Fetcha (yt-dlp-MAX) to achieve feature parity with queue items, fixing playback issues and adding missing functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. DownloadHistory Service (`/yt-dlp-MAX/Services/DownloadHistory.swift`)

#### Enhanced DownloadRecord Structure
- Added `actualFilePath` field to store the complete file path (not just directory)
- Added `thumbnail` field to store thumbnail URLs
- Added `uploader` field to store channel/uploader name
- Added computed properties:
  - `resolvedFilePath`: Returns actual file path if available, otherwise directory path
  - `filename`: Extracts just the filename from the path
- Added backward compatibility with custom decoder for existing history records

#### New Methods
- `findActualFile(for:)`: Intelligent file finding that:
  - First checks the stored actual file path
  - Falls back to searching in the directory using title matching
  - Returns the most likely media file based on title keywords and creation date

#### Updated Methods
- `addToHistory()`: Now accepts additional parameters for thumbnail, uploader, and actual file path
- `verifyDownloadExists()`: Now checks both actual file path and download directory

### 2. MediaControlBar (`/yt-dlp-MAX/Views/MediaControlBar.swift`)

#### Fixed Playback Functionality
- `playCurrentFile()`: Now uses `DownloadHistory.findActualFile()` for robust file discovery
- `showInFinder()`: Enhanced to properly handle both files and directories
- Added filename display below title when available and different

#### Improved Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing files
- Falls back to directory opening when file not found
- Logs all operations for debugging

### 3. VideoDetailsPanel (`/yt-dlp-MAX/Views/VideoDetailsPanel.swift`)

#### Added Missing Features for History Items
- Thumbnail display (using AsyncThumbnailView)
- Uploader/channel name display
- Actual filename display (not just directory)
- "Open in Browser" button for source URL
- "Copy Source URL" button
- Enhanced file operations using `DownloadHistory.findActualFile()`

#### UI Improvements
- Consistent button layout matching queue items
- Better visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- All actions now available for history items

### 4. FileHistoryPanel (`/yt-dlp-MAX/Views/FileHistoryPanel.swift`)

#### Enhanced Display
- Shows actual filename alongside timestamp
- Improved context menu with all queue item features:
  - Open File
  - Show in Finder
  - Open in Browser
  - Copy File Path
  - Copy Source URL
  - Display uploader info (when available)

#### Better File Operations
- Uses `DownloadHistory.findActualFile()` for reliable file access
- Handles missing files gracefully
- Shows both title and filename for clarity

### 5. DownloadQueue (`/yt-dlp-MAX/Services/DownloadQueue.swift`)

#### Enhanced History Recording
- Now captures actual file path after download
- Records file size by reading file attributes
- Passes thumbnail URL and uploader info to history
- Properly separates directory path from actual file path

## Technical Details

### File Discovery Algorithm
The new `findActualFile()` method uses a sophisticated approach:
1. Check stored actual file path
2. If directory, search for media files
3. Clean title of special characters for better matching
4. Extract first 3 words as keywords
5. Sort files by creation date
6. Match files containing title keywords
7. Fall back to most recent media file if no match

### Backward Compatibility
- Custom `Codable` implementation ensures old history records work
- All new fields are optional with sensible defaults
- No migration required for existing data

### Supported Media Extensions
The system recognizes: mp4, webm, mkv, avi, mov, flv, mp3, m4a, opus, wav, aac

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Playback**: Files can now be found and played even if moved within the download directory
2. **Feature Parity**: History items have all the features of queue items
3. **Better UX**: Users see actual filenames and have quick access to all actions
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or moved files
5. **Enhanced Navigation**: MediaControlBar properly navigates through history with file playback

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with existing history (backward compatibility)
2. Download new items and verify all metadata is captured
3. Move files within download directory and test playback
4. Delete files and verify graceful handling
5. Test navigation through history with MediaControlBar
6. Verify thumbnail display for new downloads
7. Test all context menu actions in FileHistoryPanel

## Known Limitations

- Thumbnails for old history items won't be available (not stored previously)
- Files moved outside the download directory won't be found automatically
- Very old downloads might not have uploader information

## Future Enhancements

- Cache thumbnail images locally for faster loading
- Add file watcher to track moved files
- Implement smart search across all common directories
- Add batch operations for history management
