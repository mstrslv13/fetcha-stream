# v0.3.1 Media Controls and History Panel Fixes

## Date: 2025-09-04
## Version: v0.3.1

## Issues Fixed

### 1. History Panel Selection
**Problem**: Files could not be selected from the history panel - clicking did nothing
**Solution**: 
- Added selection state tracking in `FileHistoryPanel`
- Implemented proper click handling with `onTapGesture` 
- Added visual feedback (background color) for selected items
- Added context menu for file operations (Open, Show in Finder, Copy Path)
- Implemented notification system to communicate selection to MediaControlBar

### 2. File Playback
**Problem**: Playing a file only opened Finder to the folder, not the actual file
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `playCurrentFile()` in MediaControlBar to:
  - First check if file exists at the stored path
  - If exists, open the actual file with `NSWorkspace.shared.open(url)`
  - If not found, try to find similar files in the parent directory
  - As fallback, show in Finder with file selection
- Added similar fixes to DockMenuService for consistency

### 3. Media Control Independence
**Problem**: When a file was deselected in the queue, media control buttons became useless
**Solution**:
- Made MediaControlBar maintain its own independent state
- Added `MediaSelectionCoordinator` to manage selection across panels
- MediaControlBar now tracks its own `currentFile` and `currentIndex`
- Queue selection and history navigation are now independent
- Added notification handlers to sync with history panel selections

### 4. Dynamic Completed Counter
**Problem**: The "30 completed" counter seemed hardcoded and didn't update correctly
**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded limit in display
- Counter now shows actual count: `completedDownloads.count`
- Properly combines queue completed items with download history
- Removes duplicates based on videoId
- Updates dynamically as downloads complete

### 5. Dock Quick Actions
**Problem**: Dock Quick Actions had the same file opening issues
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `openFile()` method in DockMenuService
- Added file existence check before opening
- Falls back to opening parent folder if file not found
- Consistent behavior with main app file opening

## Files Modified

1. **FileHistoryPanel.swift**
   - Added `selectedHistoryItem` state
   - Implemented selection handling in `FileHistoryRow`
   - Added context menu for file operations
   - Added notification posting for selection events

2. **MediaControlBar.swift**
   - Complete rewrite with independent state management
   - Enhanced file opening logic with fallback strategies
   - Dynamic counter implementation
   - Added notification receivers for cross-panel communication
   - Better handling of missing files

3. **EnhancedQueueView.swift**
   - Added notification posting when queue items are selected
   - Maintains queue selection independently

4. **DockMenuService.swift**
   - Enhanced file opening with existence checks
   - Fallback to parent folder if file missing

5. **MediaSelectionCoordinator.swift** (NEW)
   - Central coordinator for selection state
   - Manages selection across different panels
   - Prevents selection conflicts

## Technical Details

### Selection Architecture
- Each panel maintains its own selection state
- Notifications used for cross-panel communication
- MediaControlBar maintains independent navigation state
- Coordinator pattern prevents selection conflicts

### File Opening Strategy
1. Check if file exists at stored path
2. If not, search parent directory for similar files
3. If found, open the matching file
4. Otherwise, show in Finder with selection
5. Log all actions for debugging

### State Management
- `@StateObject` for singleton coordinators
- `@State` for local component state
- `NotificationCenter` for cross-component events
- Independent state prevents coupling between panels

## Testing Recommendations

1. **History Panel Selection**
   - Click items in history panel
   - Verify selection highlight appears
   - Test context menu operations

2. **File Playback**
   - Test opening completed downloads
   - Test with moved/renamed files
   - Verify fallback behaviors

3. **Media Controls**
   - Navigate with Previous/Next buttons
   - Test with queue selection/deselection
   - Verify counter updates correctly

4. **Dock Menu**
   - Test opening recent downloads from dock
   - Verify grouped by date display
   - Test with missing files

## Known Limitations

- If a file has been moved and renamed significantly, it may not be found automatically
- The fallback search uses filename similarity which may not always find the correct file
- History records are limited to prevent unbounded growth (10,000 items max)

## Future Improvements

- Add file watching to detect moved/renamed files
- Implement more sophisticated file matching algorithms
- Add option to update file paths in history when files are moved
- Consider adding file hash tracking for better identification
