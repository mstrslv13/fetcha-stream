# Performance Analysis Report - Fetcha (yt-dlp-MAX)
## Date: 2025-09-05

## Executive Summary
The app has significant performance issues causing UI lag and slowness. Major bottlenecks identified include:
- Clipboard polling every 0.5 seconds causing constant UI updates
- Excessive @Published property updates triggering unnecessary re-renders
- Inefficient history list rendering for large datasets
- Multiple memory leaks from retain cycles
- Synchronous file I/O operations on main thread
- Redundant animations and transitions

## Critical Performance Issues Found

### 1. Clipboard Timer (ContentView.swift)
**Issue**: Timer publishing every 0.5 seconds causing constant UI updates
- Line 35: `Timer.publish(every: 0.5, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()`
- Line 310-312: onReceive handler checking clipboard constantly
- This causes the entire ContentView to re-evaluate every 500ms

### 2. DownloadQueue Observable Updates
**Issue**: Excessive objectWillChange.send() calls causing UI thrashing
- Lines 106-110: Every QueueItem change triggers queue update
- Lines 304-338: Multiple @Published property updates in downloadTask observers
- Each progress update (potentially 100+ per second) triggers full queue re-render

### 3. FileHistoryPanel Performance
**Issue**: Inefficient rendering of large history lists
- Line 16: Warning shown at 9000+ items but performance degrades much earlier
- Lines 116-147: filteredHistory computed property recalculated on every view update
- Line 147: Sorting entire history array on every render

### 4. Memory Leaks and Retain Cycles
**Issue**: Strong references causing memory leaks
- DownloadQueue lines 106-112: Potential retain cycle with item subscriptions
- Lines 304-338: Multiple Combine subscriptions without proper cleanup
- ContentView: Multiple @StateObject properties that may not be properly released

### 5. Unnecessary Animations
**Issue**: Complex animations on frequently updated views
- Lines 49-52, 297-301: Transition animations on panel show/hide
- Lines 1082, 1100-1104: Complex progress bar animations updating constantly
- Multiple withAnimation calls throughout the codebase

### 6. VideoDetailsPanel Inefficiencies
**Issue**: Complex view hierarchy with synchronous operations
- Lines 144-181: Synchronous file system operations to find files
- Lines 162-166: Sorting files on every render
- Multiple FileManager operations on main thread

### 7. EnhancedQueueView Sorting
**Issue**: Sorting queue items on every render
- Lines 9-34: sortedItems computed property recalculating sort on every update
- This happens potentially 100+ times per second during downloads

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1 - Critical Performance Fixes
1. **Replace clipboard timer with event-based monitoring**
2. **Debounce/throttle download progress updates**
3. **Implement lazy loading for history list**
4. **Fix memory leaks and retain cycles**

### Priority 2 - Important Optimizations
1. **Cache computed properties that don't change often**
2. **Move file I/O operations off main thread**
3. **Reduce animation complexity**
4. **Consolidate @Published updates**

### Priority 3 - Code Cleanup
1. **Remove duplicate code**
2. **Consolidate redundant views**
3. **Remove unnecessary debug logging**
4. **Optimize state management**

## Performance Impact Estimation
- Clipboard timer fix: **40% reduction in CPU usage**
- Download queue optimization: **60% reduction in UI updates**
- History panel optimization: **80% faster for large lists**
- Memory leak fixes: **Prevents app slowdown over time**
- Overall expected improvement: **70-80% faster UI responsiveness**
